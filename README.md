## [IMDB - Searching, Rating and Reviewing movies !](https://localhost:8081)

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ </br>
This is my first self-learned FullStack project! </br>
The main purpose of this project is to practice code that includes both the client and the server side, working with web servers, databases and frameworks.

The client side is written with JavaScript, CSS and ReactJS (including materialUI and styled-components) while using GraphQL and react-apollo. </br>
The sever is written with Go (including ent and gqlgen) and Java (Spring Boot) the databases we use is MySQL & MongoDB.

_I'm not associated/connected with nor speak for "IMDB" site._

_The main welcome page's photo Belong to "NETFLIX" inc._ 

_Notice That Im currently working on the app, so NEW FEATURES are been added on daily basics!_

But, if your looking for pre-made data to insert, Here's what you need to do to get it:

1. Create a user in the registration form.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Click on you avatar on the top - right corner and then click on "insert data" option.
